# Note: 
# This list contains only the packages for converting notebooks to HTML pages
# Because it is not recommended to run notebooks for TensorFlow models locally. Instead, they should be run Google Colab.
# There are 2 reasons for this:
# 1. Training these models requires a GPU; otherwise it takes extremely long
# 2. The TensorFlow Model Zoo Object Detection API is deprecated, although it is still a main source for pretrained tensorflow object detection models.
# Because it's no longer supported, there are many packages conflicts during the training, evaluation, and inference.
# For example: training and evaluating the same model require different Pillow versions.
# Please refer to the notebooks for more details and instructions.
# When doing our experiments, we solved this problem by putting necessary cells in order and executing cell by cell in a notebook.
